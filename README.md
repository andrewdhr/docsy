# Docsy for TELUS

The original [docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) project is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme for technical documentation sets, providing simple navigation, site structure, and more, which is actively being maintained by Google Open Source.

This repository, which is a modified version of the **docsy** theme, adapts for the needs and use cases of internal technical documentation sites at TELUS.

## Example and Usage

You can start with an example project that uses this theme in the [TELUS Awesome Team repo](https://github.com/andrewdhr/telus-awesome-team). The **TELUS Awesome Team** project is hosted at [https://andrewdhr.github.io/telus-awesome-team/](https://andrewdhr.github.io/telus-awesome-team/), which is a preview of this theme and contains all the information you need to use this beautiful centralized Web-UI for your team/project at TELUS.
